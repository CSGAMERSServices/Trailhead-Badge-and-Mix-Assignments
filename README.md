## TODOs:

* Support new request: Support Trails (only TrailMixes and Badges currently supported)

* I fixed the pagination issue in apex, but should be tested more. (Deleting the items from the list was failing, so I implemented a splice instead)

* The pagination can either be done on the server (through offset - like it is now), or all items can be returned and the component paginates.
  * Moving to the browser will make the code simpler to understand.
  * but generally we recommend reducing data sent like it is now.

* The `Both` (both Badges and TrailMixes is the cause of most of the issues on Apex, as the pagination must be done by hand)
  * I think I did the best option to solve the issue, but should be further reviewed.

* Use of custom settings

* We really should cleanup the names of the files and the apex code a bit for clarity - (ex: uB / uC, etc). I took first stab at it.
faster for loading the home screen fast as it won't be touched often.

* migrate the code from the controller of the myT_AssignedEntry to helpers. (I understand it is more in-line, but it is better practice. I'll leave it to your judgement.
